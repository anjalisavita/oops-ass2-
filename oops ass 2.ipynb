    "# Abstraction in OOP: Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on representing only the essential features without including the background details. It involves hiding the complex implementation while showing only the necessary features of an object. For instance, think of a car. You don't need to know how the engine works internally to drive a car; you just need to know how to operate the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift."

Encapsulation would be achieved by making the attributes of the Circle class (radius) private using Python's naming conventions (e.g., _radius), and providing methods to access or modify them indirectly."

Abstract classes define methods that must be implemented by subclasses but may also contain implemented methods. Interfaces, on the other hand, only declare the method signatures without providing any implementation. By using these concepts, you can enforce the behavior of subclasses while hiding their internal workings."
